# Entail: Next Boilerplate
## The only Next Js Boilerplate Template You'll need to start your Project

This is a boilerplate template to kickstart your Next.js development projects. It provides a clean and well-structured foundation with essential tools and configurations to get you up and running quickly.

### Features

* **Next.js:** Latest version of Next.js framework for server-side rendering, static site generation, and more.
* **React:** Leverages React for building dynamic and interactive user interfaces.
* **Linting and Formatting:** Enforces code quality with Husky, ESLint and Prettier for a consistent codebase.
* **Organized Structure:** Follows a well-defined directory structure for easy navigation and maintainability.

### Getting Started

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/nischaltimalsina/next-boilerplate.git
   ```

2. **Install dependencies:**

   ```bash
   cd next-boilerplate
   npm install
   ```

   (or)

   ```bash
   yarn install
   ```

3. **Start the development server:**

   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

   (or)

   ```bash
   yarn dev
   ```

   This will open your application in the default browser, typically at `http://localhost:3000`.

### Project Structure

The boilerplate utilizes a standardized structure to keep your project organized:

* **public:** Static assets like images, fonts, and favicons.
* **src:** Contains the core application code:
    * **app:** Next.js app directory representing the different routes of your application.
    * **components:** Reusable React components for building UI elements.
    * **styles:** Global and component-specific stylesheets (consider using CSS Modules).
    * and much more 
* **package.json:** Manages project dependencies and scripts.
* **.eslintrc.cjs:** ESLint configuration for code linting.
* **next.config.js:** Optional configuration file for Next.js settings.

### Customization

* **Favicons:** Replace the placeholder favicons in the `public` folder with your own.
* **Branding:** Update the global styles in `src/styles` to match your brand identity.
* **Components:** Develop your custom components in the `src/components` directory.
* **Screens:** Organize your page components and control them in the `src/screens` directory.
* **Pages:** Create new pages in the `src/app` directory to define new application routes.
